Easy:
+ fix non-colliding floor in room 6
+ respawn button ( if stuck )
+ make hover bots louder?
+ fix problem running with gun holstered but aimed
+ disable gun/bullet/mag shadows
+ framerate cap?
+ make mouse cursor disappear when tabbing back into game
+ remove round from magazine (for combining etc)
+ menu correctly fades to black on start
- randomize falling damage?
- indicator that cheat code is needed for slow motion
- indicator on screen that cheat code has been used
- investigate jump-higher-by-crouching, possibly add to help
- add "stop aiming to run" to help
- problem dropping two mags in the same place?
- fix sight picture for 1911 (sights should be level)
- inventory markers
- spawn empty mags on ground
- "night vision" light? (small blue point light that follows camera)
